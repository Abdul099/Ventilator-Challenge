### This project contains the Arduino Code used for the Ventilator Device built by the MBEC Ventilator Team as part of the Code Life Challenge. The code consists of a sketch that drives an Arduino UNO responsible for the sensor input and motor output, and another one that drives an Arduino Mega, which controls the User Interface. Both Arduinos communicate using the i2c communication protocol with the master being the Arduino UNO.
